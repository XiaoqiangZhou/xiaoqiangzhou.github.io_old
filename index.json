This paper shows that statistics aggregated on the patches-based/entire-image-based feature in the training/testing phase respectively may distribute very differently. The test-time solution can be summarized as converting the statistics aggregation operation from global to local, i.e. each pixel of the feature aggregates its own statistics locally.  Method:    Figure 1: Illustration of training and testing schemes of image restoration   The computational complexity of local statistics for the whole image can be reduced from $O(HWK_hK_w)$ to $O(HW)$ with some mathematical tricks.   Figure 2: Formulation of the global statistics calculation    Figure 3: Formulation of the local statistics calculation   The authors extend the proposed modules to the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block and Instance Normalization (IN) block.

your_log.log 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp;\n之后只能通过查看log文件，来了解程序运行输出情况。不能像tmux那样进入窗口查看。\ntop，htop，ps -aux：这三个都是用来查看本机运行的任务的，按需取用。htop和ps -aux可以比较方便的定位到具体的任务对应的PID进行，方便进行Kill\nscp：用来进行数据传输。\n服务器下载文件到本地：scp username@server_ip_address:文件在服务器的路径 文件在本地的保存路径\n本机文件传递给服务器： scp 文件在本地的保存路径 username@server_ip_address:文件在服务器的路径\n连接服务器需要指定端口时，加入-P （大写）参数\nnvidia-smi，gpustat：这两个命令都可以用来查看当前机器的显卡占用情况，gpustat需要使用pip进行安装，界面简洁好看些。\ntensorboard：用于查看训练过程中的结果\n基本设置为：tensorboard --logdir path_to_log --port your_port\n之后用浏览器打开 http://localhost:your_port即可，默认端口6006\n打开服务器上的log文件\n连接服务器：ssh -L 本地端口:127.0.0.1:服务器端口 username@server_ip_address\n在服务器上执行：tensorboard --logdir path_to_log --port 服务器端口\n在本地浏览器打开：http://localhost:本地端口\ntensorboard的使用，需要pip安装tensorboard库，如果安装完之后还是没有，需要寻找对应的文件\nalias tensorboard='python /home/username/anaconda3/envs/your_env_name/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorboard/main.py'\nwhich\n可以用于查看当前使用的命令路径，例如：which nvcc\nPyTorch笔记  关于device   DataParallel会自动将输入数据映射到对应的模型device上，验证代码：  def verify_device():\rclass net(nn.Module):\rdef __init__(self):\rsuper(net, self).__init__()\rdef forward(self, inputs):\rprint(\u0026quot;data's device in model: \u0026quot;, inputs.device)\rmy_net = net()\rmy_net = nn.DataParallel(my_net.cuda()) # my_net = my_net.cuda()\rinputs = torch.ones((16, 3, 256, 256))\rprint(\u0026quot;data's device out model: \u0026quot;, inputs.device)\rmy_net(inputs)\r 利用DataParallel 只将模型放在GPU上，而没有将输入放在GPU上，输出结果如下：\ndata's device out model: cpu\rdata's device in model: cuda:0\rdata's device in model: cuda:1\rdata's device in model: cuda:2\rdata's device in model: cuda:3\rdata's device in model: cuda:5\rdata's device in model: cuda:6\rdata's device in model: cuda:7\rdata's device in model: cuda:4\r 如果使用注释中的my_net = my_net.cuda()，则得到\ndata's device out model: cpu\rdata's device in model: cpu\r BUG记录  PyTorch的dataloader一旦执行  for iter, batch in enumerate(dataloader):\n会卡住很久，进入__getitem__进行debug发现一直在读取图片，虽然我使用的并不是opencv库进行数据读取\n解决办法：在主程序中加入cv2.setNumThreads(0)\n谷歌搜索关键字：pytorch dataloader stucks\nTensorflow多次load模型(为了进行多次测试)时，可能会出现  ValueError: Variable *** already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True or reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE in VarScope? \n这种情况，通常是需要在代码中加入，每次load模型前清理一次计算图tf.reset_default_graph()\n基于PyTorch的代码，训练效果还不错，测试效果很糟糕，排除过拟合的原因以及测试代码的问题。最后发现是该代码在测试时需要指定  model.train()\n程序报错：cudnn_status_not_initialized  可能是因为当前显卡正在被其他任务占用\n安装neural_renderer_pytorch  RuntimeError: Error compiling objects for extension\n解决办法：将pytorch的版本从1.5降到1.2\n多卡GPU训练，保存的也是多卡模型，却需要单卡测试  Unexpected key(s) in state_dict: \u0026quot;module.*\u0026quot;\n解决办法：\nmodel.load_state_dict({k.replace('module.', ''): v for k, v in torch.load(model_state_path).items()})\n模型在GPU上训练，需要在CPU上测试，跑inference  解决办法：\nckpt = torch.load(model_path, map_location=torch.device(\u0026quot;cpu\u0026quot;))\n程序报错: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘network’  原因：保存模型时使用的是torch.save(model) 而不是torch.save(model.state_dict)\n解决办法：在执行模型保存命令的py文件路径下，再次读取模型，并使用torch.save(model.state_dict)来保存模型\n","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607990400,"objectID":"299a8668a6985fe3bd61c6b0f83b582f","permalink":"http://xiaoqiangzhou.cn/post/code_notes/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/code_notes/","section":"post","summary":"Personal Code Notes","tags":["Coding","PyTorch"],"title":"Code Notes","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xin Ma","Xiaoqiang Zhou","Huaibo Huang","Gengyun Jia","Zhenhua Chai","Xiaolin Wei"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.   --\rMethod:    Figure 1: Overall Framework  The self-supervised Siamese inference network consists of encoders $E_q$ and $E_k$.
